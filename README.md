# NBA Data Warehouse and Analytics Pipeline

Data engineering and analytics project designing a structured data warehouse and analytics pipeline for NBA performance data using Python, SQL, and dimensional data modeling to support scalable querying and data-driven insights.

---

## Executive Summary

This project developed a structured data warehouse and analytics pipeline to support efficient analysis of NBA player, team, and game performance data. The system was designed to transform raw, unstructured sports data into a clean, structured format suitable for scalable querying, reporting, and analytics.

The project demonstrates key data engineering and analytics capabilities, including data modeling, pipeline development, and structured analytics workflows. These capabilities are directly applicable to healthcare analytics, clinical data systems, and enterprise data platforms.

## Overview

Modern analytics systems require structured, well-designed data architectures to enable efficient querying and analysis. Raw data is often fragmented, unstructured, and difficult to analyze without transformation into a structured data model.

This project designed and implemented a structured data warehouse to organize NBA performance data into a scalable format suitable for analytics and reporting.

The system enables efficient analysis of player performance, team performance, and game-level metrics.

## Business Problem

Raw NBA performance data is difficult to analyze efficiently due to:

• Fragmented and unstructured data formats  
• Lack of standardized schema for analytics  
• Difficulty performing scalable queries across multiple datasets  
• Limited ability to generate consistent analytical insights  

A structured data warehouse enables scalable, efficient analytics and reporting.

## Approach

The project followed a structured data engineering and analytics workflow:

### Data Ingestion

• Imported raw NBA performance data  
• Loaded data into Python environment for processing  

---

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

• Cleaned and standardized data fields  
• Removed inconsistencies and missing values  
• Structured data into normalized format  

---

### Data Modeling

• Designed structured relational schema  
• Organized data into logical tables  
• Established relationships between entities  

Examples of entities:

• Players  
• Teams  
• Games  
• Performance statistics  

This structure supports efficient querying and scalable analytics.
