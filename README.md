# NBA Data Warehouse and Analytics Pipeline

Graduate-level data engineering project designing a structured analytics database and pipeline to transform raw performance data into a scalable data warehouse supporting efficient querying, reporting, and data-driven analysis.

---

## Executive Summary

This project developed a structured data warehouse and analytics pipeline to support efficient analysis of NBA player, team, and game performance data. The system transforms raw, unstructured sports data into a clean, structured format suitable for scalable querying, reporting, and analytics.

The project demonstrates key data engineering and analytics capabilities, including data modeling, ETL pipeline development, and structured analytics workflows. These capabilities are directly applicable to healthcare analytics, clinical data systems, and enterprise data platforms.

## Overview

Modern analytics systems require structured, well-designed data architectures to enable efficient querying and analysis. Raw data is often fragmented, unstructured, and difficult to analyze without transformation into a structured data model.

This project designed and implemented a structured data warehouse to organize NBA performance data into a scalable relational structure suitable for analytics and reporting.

The resulting system enables efficient analysis of player performance, team performance, and game-level metrics.

## Business Problem

Raw NBA performance data presents several challenges for analytics:

• Fragmented and unstructured data formats  
• Lack of standardized schema for scalable analytics  
• Difficulty performing efficient queries across multiple datasets  
• Limited ability to generate consistent analytical insights  

A structured data warehouse enables scalable, efficient querying, reporting, and analytics.

## Approach

The project followed a structured data engineering and analytics workflow.

### Data Ingestion

• Imported raw NBA performance data  
• Loaded data into Python environment for processing  

---

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

• Cleaned and standardized data fields  
• Removed inconsistencies and handled missing values  
• Transformed data into structured format suitable for analysis  

---

### Data Modeling

• Designed structured relational schema using dimensional modeling principles  
• Organized data into logical entities and tables  

Key entities included:

• Players  
• Teams  
• Games  
• Performance statistics  

This structure supports efficient querying and scalable analytics.
